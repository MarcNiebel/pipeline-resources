# Overview

The [World Health Organization (WHO) has classified the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.529 variant as a Variant of Concern (VoC)](https://www.who.int/news/item/26-11-2021-classification-of-omicron-(b.1.1.529)-sars-cov-2-variant-of-concern) under the advice of the [Technical Advisory Group on SARS-CoV-2 Virus Evolution (TAG-VE)](https://www.who.int/groups/technical-advisory-group-on-sars-cov-2-virus-evolution)—an independent group of experts that periodically monitors and evaluates the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and assess if specific mutations and combinations of mutations alter the behavior of the virus. The WHO has assigned the B.1.1.529 VoC the label Omicron as per the [their greek-letter key variant assignment system](https://www.who.int/news/item/31-05-2021-who-announces-simple-easy-to-say-labels-for-sars-cov-2-variants-of-interest-and-concern).  The elevation of Omicron to a WHO-designated VoC was based on the TAG-VE's assessment of the variant’s large number of genomic mutations and plausible impact on COVID-19 epidemiology. 

The PHA4GE Pipelines and Visualization Working Group has created this document as an attempt to highlight critical open-source/accesses resources to aid in the understanding and further analysis of the Omicron variant. 

In no way does this document represent a comprehensive list of all available SC2 bioinformatics resources. If this document fails to include a valuable public health resource or in some way mischaracterizes a resource mentioned, we encourage community collaboration through pull-requests and/or raised GitHub issues.
