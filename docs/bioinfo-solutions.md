# Overview

Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 (SC2) samples is an increasingly critical function to public health laboratories around the world. Integration of the appropriate bioinformatics solutions to support these works, however, can be an overwhelming challenge.

 In an attempt to assist this integration process, the bioinformatics pipeline and visualization working group of the Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) has drafted this living document to help define the major bioinformatics challenges for SC2 genomic analysis and suggest various open-source and freely available bioinformatics resources to address them.

Please note that the bioinformatics resources listed in this document are simply an attempt to highlight the most accessible solutions **as per the opinions of our working group** and in no way represent a comprehensive list of all available SC2 bioinformatics resources. If this document fails to include a valuable public health resource or in some way mischaracterizes a resource mentioned, we encourage community collaboration through pull-requests and/or raised GitHub issues.

# Bioinformatics Challenges for Public Health

The PHA4GE bioinformatics pipeline and visualization working group has defined four key public health bioinformatics challenges for genomic analysis of SC2 samples:

1. **Generating consensus assemblies from PCR tiling NGS data:** Tiled amplicon sequencing--through the Artic V3 protocol, for example--is the most commonly adopted method for generating SC2 sequencing data. These sequencing experiments generate thousands of amplicon reads that represent fragments of the original SC2 genome present in a sample. As a result, one of the first bioinformatics challenges laboratories run into is the assembly of PCR tiling NGS data into a contiguous SC2 genome from which powerful public health insights can be derived, such as lineage typing and genomic epidemiology studies that help inform public-health decision making.

2. **Submitting raw sequence data (fastq), consensus assemblies (fasta), and relevant sample metadata to internationally-accessible databases:** Sharing of sample read and assembly data through internationally accessible databases allows insights to be drawn about how the virus is spreading and mutating across the globe; the more freely available these data are to international researchers and public health scientists, the stronger our decision making can be.

3. **Screening sequenced SC2 samples for variants of concern:** The detection of certain genetic variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may have a significant impact on the decisions of public health officials. Thus, an ability to accurately and reliably screen for variants of interest and variants of concern, such as B.1.1.7 or B.1.617, is a critical component to the bioinformatics analysis of SC2 genomes.

4. **Performing phylogenetic analysis of SC2 datasets:** Genetic relatedness as inferred through phylogenetic analysis of SC2 datasets can be a powerful proxy for epidemiological associations that help resolve transmission networks, enable real-time surveillance, provide insights of the variance-over-time of SC2 samples, and support local outbreak investigations

# Community Resources

## 1. Generating consensus assemblies from PCR tiling NGS data

The bioinformatics resources listed below are open-source pipelines that run on general-purpose, containerized workflow infrastructure to generate consensus SC2 assemblies from PCR tiling NGS data. While some parameters and modules may differ slightly, each pipeline will perform read mapping to the Wuhan-1 reference genome, remove primer regions from the mapped read data, and generate a consensus assembly based on conserved and variant positions identified in the resulting alignment. These resources have been organized into three categories: [Terra](app.terra.bio) and [Galaxy](https://galaxyproject.org/) Workflows, Web-Accessible Software as a Service (SaaS) Solutions, and Command-Line Interface (CLI) gools and are listed in no particular order.

## 2. Sharing raw sequence data (fastq) and consensus assemblies (fasta) through internationally-accessible databases (GISAID/NCBI)

Below is a list of resources developed to assist in the preparation and submission of raw NGS read data (fastq files), SC2 consensus assemblies (fasta files), and contextual sample metadata to internationally-accessible databases. We have also included a list of bioinformatics software designed to assess the quality of SC2 data; we recommend the use of such software prior to submission to avoid the inadvertent sharing of poor quality, contaminated, or otherwise misleading SC2 data. Additional information regarding the interpretation of read and assembly quality metrics for SC2 data will be made available as a separate document.
