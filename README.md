# PHA4GE Bioinformatics Pipelines and Visualization Working Group Resources
A repository to host [PHA4GE-developed](https://pha4ge.org/) guidance documents and resources that address common challenges regarding the integration of bioinformatics solutions for the global public health community.


## SARS-CoV-2 Resources
### [Bioinformatics Solutions](docs/bioinfo-solutions.md)
In an attempt to assist this integration process, the bioinformatics pipeline and visualization working group of the Public Health Alliance for Genomic Epidemiology (PHA4GE) has drafted this living document to help define the major bioinformatics challenges for SC2 genomic analysis and suggest various open-source and freely available bioinformatics resources to address them.
